How I felt was unexpected. I was purely filled with joy. I couldn\u2019t even find it in me to be sad because I felt it would make me so greedy. How could I ask for more when God has blessed me with this much? She left me not a day before, not a day after, but waited until the actual DAY of my wedding. How amazing is that? All the tears I shed for Bambi now are never sad; only tears of joy and gratitude at the thought of God ushering me into this new chapter of my life, after all the turbulent times I have had to endure in the past.
