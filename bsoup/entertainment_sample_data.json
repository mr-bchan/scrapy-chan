How I felt was unexpected. I was purely filled with joy. I couldn\u2019t even find it in me to be sad because I felt it would make me so greedy. How could I ask for more when God has blessed me with this much? She left me not a day before, not a day after, but waited until the actual DAY of my wedding. How amazing is that? All the tears I shed for Bambi now are never sad; only tears of joy and gratitude at the thought of God ushering me into this new chapter of my life, after all the turbulent times I have had to endure in the past.

Her mom got the custody, hence, her father \u201ctried to kidnap\u201d her at that time.\n\u201cTo protect me, my mom and I went into hiding in Olongapo where I stayed mostly indoors for the next few years. Mrs. Doubtfire was my best friend. I had the whole movie memorized.

No more kidnapping or hidden agendas. He never dressed up as a nanny either but God had healed both him and my mom and I've had two homes since then,\u201d she said.\nThe 24-year-old singer also narrated one unforgettable moment which happened in San Francisco last August.\n\u201cWe got to visit Mrs. Doubtfire's home. This time spent with my dad, however brief it was, was one of the most surreal moments of my life. It was when it sunk in how faithful God really is. It was a dream to see him again in good terms with everyone, in the proper conditions. No cases. No papers. No issues. No drama,\u201d she said.\nDela Torre said that moment was special because it was the same film that helped her understand \u201cthat love defies distance and time\u201d back when she was younger.\n\u201cI stood in front of that very house next to the man I once thought I'd never see again. Now, my dad has become a man of God, dedicated to his family. He works so hard to make sure we're all well taken care of. He is a great listener. He's everyone's favorite uncle.

The group debuted as two independent groups, EXO-M and EXO-K, promoting simultaneously in China and South Korea.\nOriginally composed of 12 members, EXO now has nine members - Suho, Chen, Chanyeol, Baekhyun, Xiumin, D.O., Kai, Sehun and Lay.\nEXO is currently promoting their fourth album \"The War\" through their concert tour, Exo Planet #4 - The Elyxion. Fans can get a glimpse of their favorite group as they fly to Manila for a concert on April 28.\nHere are some of group's hits songs for those who want to get a taste of EXO's music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAMA\nWhen EXO debuted in April 2012, the group didn't just walk into the K-pop scene. They made an explosive entrance with \"MAMA,\" a punk-esque track laced with Gregorian chants. The music video, lasting six minutes long, also includes an extensive narration explaining the group's unique concept of being aliens possessing superpowers.\n\n\nGROWL\nOver a year after its debut, EXO already had a steady following. But it was the addictive and funky \"Growl\" that served as a game-changer and brought the group mainstream success. It remains their most iconic song and even listed among Billboard's Top 100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time.\n\n\nOVERDOSE\nProduced by American R&B/pop duo The Underdogs, \"Overdose,\" released in May 2014, likens a man's intense attraction to the feeling of a \"sweet\" drug overdose. The music video is a visual feast, showing members performing choreography in a labrynth-like setting.\n\n\nCALL ME BABY\nReleased in 2015, \"Call Me Baby\" is part of EXO's \"Exodus\" album as its lead single. The music video features handsome cars and the members clad in leather, dancing in what looks like an empty warehouse.\n\n\nMONSTER\nOne year after the success of \"Exodus,\" EXO once again released another masterpiece. Unlike their previous singles, \"Monster\" has a darker and more intense feel. The music video features the members, bruised and clad in black, as they sing about obsession and love.\n\n\nFOR LIFE\nReleased in December 2016 as the title track off the special winter album, \"For Life\" has EXO bringing warmth to the otherwise cold season.

It just burrows down inside of you,\" the movie's star Will Smith said in a preview video.\nCinemaCon was also shown a new trailer for \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" as well as the opening sequence of animation \"Incredibles 2\" from Disney-owned Pixar and scenes from Rob Marshall's upcoming holiday release, \"Mary Poppins Returns,\" starring Emily Blunt.\nThere was a marked difference in presentation style as Warner Bros. previewed its slate later in the day, adding some welcome pizzazz with a roll call of its biggest names.\nIt set out its stall with a parade of its DC Comics superheroes, treating delegates to behind-the-scenes footage from \"Aquaman\" and sending director James Wan onstage to introduce a \"work-in-progress\" trailer.\nThe footage of what is expected to be one of this year's big Christmas films gave delegates a glimpse of the mythical underwater world of Atlantis, its distinctly humanoid residents riding sea horses into battle.\nComedian and actor Will Arnett, playing host on behalf of Warner Bros., lightheartedly chided \"Aquaman\" star Jason Momoa for indulging in some rather colorful language.\n\"You went from 'Game of Thrones' to 'Aquaman,'\" Arnett told the musclebound 38-year-old Polynesian-American, his mouth curling into a smirk. \n\"Does it feel good to work in something that's more realistic?\"\nCheeky questions\n\"Have you ever wanted to play a character who wears a shirt?\" Arnett demanded, as Momoa, joined onstage by co-stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, took the cheeky line of enquiry in good spirit.\nWarner showed a brief sizzle reel of the numerous superhero projects in its DC Extended Universe pipeline, featuring David F. Sandberg's \"Shazam!\" and Patty Jenkins chatting about \"Wonder Woman 2,\" which she revealed will be set in the 1980s.\nThe cast of \"Ocean's 8\" -- led by Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett -- turned up to pique excitement over the female-skewed heist spin-off, and Bradley Cooper appeared for \"A Star is Born.\" \nA trailer for the romance, which he stars in and directs, was praised by the Hollywood press for the chemistry between the \"Hangover\" actor and pop sensation Lady Gaga. \n\"I always wanted to tell a love story and this project was around before and it always stayed with me... to me, music is the purest way you can communicate love,\" Cooper said.\nSTX Films -- in business for just three years -- closed out CinemaCon Tuesday with a showcase of nautical thriller \"Adrift,\" starring Shailene Woodley (\"Divergent\").\nWoodley, 26, described the movie as \"a survival story that's really about true love\" and tenacity in the face of adversity. \n\"It's not every day you get to work with a filmmaker who is willing to shoot this thing on the ocean,\" she added.\nJennifer Garner introduced revenge thriller \"Peppermint,\" and STX also showcased the upcoming \"Second Act,\" \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" and Peter Berg's spy drama \"Mile 22,\" starring Mark Wahlberg and Lauren Cohan.\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse", "video": [], "tags": ["CinemaCon", "Hollywood", "movies", "Disney", "Warner Bros."], "media": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh6z1HelAAh/"]}, {"url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/25/18/karla-estrada-excited-sa-bagong-season-ng-funny-ka-pare-ko", "image": ["https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/entertainment/04/25/karla-estrada.jpg"], "summary": "Para sa Season 5 ng \"Funny Ka Pare Ko,\" may mga bagong karakter na makikisaya.", "title": "Karla Estrada, excited sa bagong season ng 'Funny Ka, Pare Ko'", "timestamp": "Apr 25 03:52 PM", "story": "Karla Estrada thrilled over new 'Funny Ka, Pare Ko' season pic.twitter.com/gnE9hczSFS\n\u2014 Reyma Buan-Deveza (@reymadeveza) April 25, 2018\n\nMANILA -- Ibinahagi ni Karla Estrada ang kasiyahan sa pinakabagong season ng sitcom na \"Funny Ka, Pare Ko\" sa CineMo na magsisimula ngayong Mayo 6.\nSa panayam nitong Miyerkoles ng ABS-CBN News, magiliw na kinuwento ni Karla ang mga bagong aabangan sa \"Funny Ka, Pare Ko.\" \n\"Excited kami lagi.

Rapper Meek Mill won freedom from prison Tuesday after an unusually harsh sentence triggered protests that pointed to racial biases in US probation laws.\nThe 30-year-old Philadelphia rapper, who was jailed in November over a case from his teenage years, was ordered out on bail by Pennsylvania's Supreme Court.\nAs he walked at least temporarily free, Mill thanked supporters who campaigned for him as well as the Philadelphia district attorney's office that sided with him.\n\"I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues,\" Mill wrote on Twitter.\n\"In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career,\" said Mill, whose last album \"Wins and Losses\" reached number three on the US chart.\nMill, raised by a single mother after his father was killed, was thrown into jail over his arrest on drug and gun possession charges in 2008, well before the rapper born as Robert Rihmeek Williams achieved stardom.\nAt what had looked like a routine hearing, Philadelphia judge Genece Brinkley handed Mill a term of between two and four years for violating terms of parole, including scheduling shows that conflicted with the court schedule and entering a publicized scuffle in St. Louis.\nOrdering Mill out on bail, the state's Supreme Court cited \"credibility issues\" over a police officer who was a witness.\nMill has said he was badly beaten during the 2008 arrest and placed a bloody mug shot of himself as the cover of his \"DC4\" mixtape.\nThe Supreme Court did not throw out the case but asked the local court to reach a resolution within 60 days. It also did not remove Brinkley but noted she \"may opt to remove herself from presiding over this matter.\"\nIn addition to street rallies, Mill enjoyed the support of celebrities including hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation management signed Mill.\nIn an op-ed last year for The New York Times, Jay-Z said that Mill's case was \"just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day.\"\nProbation, which dates from English common law, was initially seen as a compassionate way for courts to grant freedom to people who pose little risk.\nBut a survey by The Marshall Project, a non-profit news organization that covers the US judicial system, found that at least 61,250 people -- and probably far more -- are in prison across the United States for minor parole violations like missing appointments, failing drug tests or staying out past curfew.", "video": [], "tags": ["Meek Mill", "rapper", "music", "US", "racism"],

therapist is suing Stan Lee of Marvel Comics fame for sexual assault and battery, accusing him of inappropriate touching and misconduct during two sessions last year in Chicago.\nMaria Carballo filed a 5-count lawsuit Monday, claiming Lee assaulted her by fondling himself and touching her with his genitalia.\nThe lawsuit claims the incidents took place in April 2017, when the 95-year-old co-creator of many superhero characters, including Black Panther and Spider-Man, was in the Midwestern city for the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo. \nLee's attorney Jonathan Freund denied the allegations to the Chicago Tribune newspaper.\n\"He is a high-profile public figure and I think it's a shakedown,\" Freund was quoted by the Tribune as saying. \n\"The guy is 95, I don't think he would do that.\"\nCarballo's lawsuit claims she was sent on two occasions to Lee's hotel suite at the McCormick Place Hyatt Regency.\nDuring the first massage, Lee allegedly fondled himself, causing Carballo to stop and leave early.\nCarballo claims that Lee apologized through her employer and she returned for a second massage appointment the following day, during which she employed a massage technique using the feet instead of hands.\nShe accuses Lee of moving her foot against his genitals, prompting her to leave once again. \nThe alleged incidents predate the global spread of the #MeToo and #Timesup campaigns.\nCarballo was initially fearful that complaining about Lee's actions would negatively affect her career, according to the law firm representing her.\n\"After seeing other women fight to be treated with dignity and respect, I decided, me too,\" Carballo said in a statement released by the Chicago-based firm Cunningham Lopez LLP.\nThe lawsuit is seeking at least $50,000, as well as punitive damages and attorney's fees for each of the five counts.\nLee has faced a similar claim before. In January, the Daily Mail reported on allegations of sexual assault and harassment by nurses who cared for Lee at his Los Angeles home.\nLee's representatives denied those allegations.\nThe comic book legend has also been the subject of rumors of elder abuse in the hands of associates and his daughter, and has denied those claims as well.", "video": [], "tags": ["Stan Lee", "sexual assault", "battery"], "media": []}, {"url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/24/18/look-scarlet-snow-is-one-adorable-avenger", "image": ["https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/entertainment/04/24/scarlet-2018-2018-042418.jpg", "https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/entertainment/04/24/scarlet-2018-2018-042418.jpg"], "summary": "With only hours left before it finally hits local cinemas, the excitement for \"Avengers: Infinity War\" has reached fever pitch.", "title": "LOOK: Scarlet Snow is one adorable Avenger", "timestamp": "Apr 24 11:07 PM", "story": "It looks like Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) has a fan in Scarlet Snow here in the Philippines\n\n\nWith only hours left before it finally hits local cinemas, the excitement for \"Avengers: Infinity War\" has reached fever pitch. \nAnd keeping the hype train rolling is Scarlet Snow, baby daughter of Vicki Belo and Hayden Kho. \nTuesday night, a photo of her dressed up as her favorite Avenger, Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, was posted on her Instagram page --which has more than 2 million followers. \n\"I don't like fighting but I also don't like bad and selfish people,\" the caption for the snap read. \"So if you're bad and selfish you better watch out because I'm coming for you!\" \n\n\n\n \n\nI don't like fighting but I also don't like bad and selfish people.

That was enough to top Dwayne Johnson's \"Rampage\" and Amy Schumer's \"I Feel Pretty.\"\nBumped down to No. 2, Dwayne Johnson's \"Rampage\" collected $20.3 million in 4,115 theaters in its second weekend. The film has made $66 million at the North American box office. Luckily, \"Rampage\" has been able to justify its expensive price tag with a strong international showing. It has crossed the $200-million mark internationally, claiming $57 million this weekend. That brings its global tally to $283 million.\nSTX's \"I Feel Pretty\" bowed in third with $15.8 million from 3,440 theaters. The Schumer-led comedy also features Michelle Williams, Rory Scovel, Emily Ratajkowski, Busy Phillips and Aidy Bryant. \"I Feel Pretty\" is currently averaging a tepid 34 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a B+ CinemaScore.\nAnother newcomer, Fox Searchlight's \"Super Troopers 2,\" opened in fourth, burning by projections to make $15 million from 2,038 locations. The sequel reunites the 2002 cult classic's leads -- Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske -- collectively known as Broken Lizard. The stoner comedy has a 35 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the same score as the original. The audience score of the sequel, however, is down significantly from the original's, at 68 percent compared to the first movie's 90 percent. The first film launched with $6 million.\nThe final weekend opener is Lionsgate's Codeblack Films' \"Traffik,\" which took in $3.9 million in 1,024 theaters.\nRounding out the top five is Universal and Blumhouse's \"Truth or Dare.\" Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey lead the thriller, which scored $7.9 million in 3,068 locations. In total, the horror film has made $30.4 million in two weeks.\nThe domestic box office is up 12.6 percent compared to the same weekend last year, though the year to date box office is down 2.4 percent. That could change next weekend as \"Avengers: Infinity War\" eyes a monstrous opening weekend.\n\"The industry is bracing for the record-setting debut of the highly anticipated 'Avengers: Infinity War' that is expected to break through the $200 million opening weekend sound barrier as the summer movie season of 2018 gets off to an early and auspicious start,\" said comScore box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian.", "video": [], "tags": ["box office", "Hollywood", "A Quiet Place", "Rampage", "Super Troopers 2"], "media": []}, {"url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/video/entertainment/04/23/18/watch-ate-vis-heartfelt-message-for-luis", "image": ["https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/entertainment/04/22/042218-atevi.jpg"], "summary": "Vilma Santos-Recto burst into tears as she expressed how proud she is of her son, Luis Manzano.", "title": "WATCH: Ate Vi's heartfelt message for Luis", "timestamp": "Apr 23 12:36 AM", "story": "", "video": [], "tags": ["I Can See Your Voice", "Vilma Santos-Recto", "Luis Manzano"], "media": []}, {"url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/23/18/i-can-see-your-voice-ate-vi-picks-perfect-contestant-for-duet-with-luis", "image": ["https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/tvpatrol/04/22/icsyv.jpg"], "summary": "Despite being a non-singer, veteran actress and politician Vilma Santos-Recto took on the challenge to pick the perfect contestant to sing a duet with her son, Luis, on \"I Can See Your Voice.\"", "title": "'I Can See Your Voice': Ate Vi picks perfect contestant for duet with Luis", "timestamp": "Apr 23 12:12 AM", "story": "Despite being a non-singer, veteran actress and politician Vilma Santos-Recto took on the challenge to pick the perfect contestant to sing a duet with her son, Luis, on \"I Can See Your Voice.\"\nSantos surprised her son for a special birthday episode.

He declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom.\nU.S. authorities have accused Mack of recruiting women to join what purported to be a female mentorship group but was actually a secret society run by Raniere, the leader of a network of purported self-help groups based in Albany, New York, called Nxivm.\nProsecutors said women recruited into his secret society, who numbered as many as 50, were branded with Raniere's initials, put on extremely restrictive diets to stay thin and forced to have sex with Raniere.\nUpon joining, they were required to provide information about family and friends, nude photographs and rights to their assets - so-called collateral used to threaten them if they left, prosecutors said.\nThe women were taught that the society would empower and strengthen them, according to prosecutors.\nMack helped Raniere control the women in exchange for financial and other benefits from him, prosecutors said.\n\"Under the guise of female empowerment, she starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal, and she targeted vulnerable women,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Kim Penza said at Friday's hearing.\nOn its website, Nxivm calls itself \"a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human.\"\nIn a letter on the site, Raniere said he was \"deeply saddened\" and denied \"abusing, coercing or harming\" anyone.\nMarc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Raniere, said earlier this month that he was \"confident these allegations will be soundly disproven.\" (Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York Editing by Leslie Adler)", "video": [], "tags": ["Allison Mack", "Smallville"], "media": []}, {"url": "https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/21/18/silipin-ibat-ibang-personalidad-na-lumahok-sa-day-2-ng-star-hunt", "image": ["https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/tvpatrol/04/21/mj.jpg"], "summary": "Payo ng dating PBB housemate na si Joshua Garcia, magpakatotoo lamang ang mga Kapamilya aspirants at ipakita ang kanilang unique na talento.", "title": "SILIPIN: Iba't ibang personalidad na lumahok sa Day 2 ng 'Star Hunt'", "timestamp": "Apr 21 08:45 PM", "story": "Watch more in iWantv or TFC.tv\nLibo-libo ang dumagsa para sa ika-2 araw ng \"Star Hunt: The Grand Kapamilya Auditions\" nitong Sabado.\n\nDay 1 ng 'Star Hunt' audition, dinagsa\n\nMatapos sumabak sa Day 1 ng auditions ang mga bata, mga aspirant na may edad 18 anyos pataas naman ang nagpamalas ng kanilang talento at nagpakita ng personality para maging \"next big star\" ng Kapamilya network.\nIsa sa mga sumubok ang working student na si Mark Stephen Can\u0303ares.
