Further, Sereno, upon her application for SC Associate Justice, submitted a \u201cfabricated\u201d SALN, for 2006, according to the OSG.\nHer 2006 SALN bears no stamp receipt from the University of the Philippines, was only signed on July 27, 2010, the same day it was submitted to the JBC, and was not notarized, the OSG explained. \n\u201cSereno, therefore, is not a person of proven integrity. Her continued occupation of the esteemed office of the Chief Justice in unlawful,\u201d the OSG argued. \nSereno urged the high court to junk the plea, maintaining that she may be removed only through impeachment proceedings.

Dormicum, just like any dangerous drug, is only prescribed by an S2 licensed physician.\n\"The drug is listed as dangerous drugs so it means that not anybody can just prescribe such drugs without authorization. If a doctor will prescribe such drug, they have to get license from Compliance Service of PDEA,\" Reyes said.\nSleeping pills tend to be abused, which is why they are not prescribed easily by any doctor.\n\"Para lang daw pampatulog niya pero what is very suspicious, iyung same doctor different patient bought 3 prescriptions in a day. Parang suspicious na sa amin yon. Tapos na-verify sa doctor na hindi naman issue ng doctor that\u2019s why this triggered the investigation that we conducted,\" Reyes said.\nTeodosio said he forged the doctor\u2019s prescription to save money. He admitted having it made in a computer shop.\n\"Para makatipid, kasi ang consultation fee ay P700, Doon sa copy P2 lang. Sa computer shops,\" he said.\n\"Minsan lang siya nagpakonsulta sa doctor na iyon tapos later on finake na niya yung mga prescription. It was the doctor who really reported this to us na napi-fake na ang kanyang prescription.\"\nThe suspect said he used the fake subscription for a year and bought around 30 tablets per month.\nPDEA said the drugstores verify if the doctor is S2 licensed or not.\n\"You have to indicate the S2 license ng doctor. Kinopya niya lang yon, may mga prescribed na data sa regulation. Pag meron silang nakikita ng suspicious na prescription, kahina-hinala na talaga tumatawag sila sa amin,\" Reyes said.\n\"Meron kaming SMS query wherein yung retailer pwede mag verify ng S2 license ng medical practitioner dito sa amin.
